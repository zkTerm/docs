## General

**1. What is zkTerm?**

zkTerm is a universal zero-knowledge terminal that unifies the entire ZK ecosystem into one interface. It provides identity, encrypted storage, token compression, and cryptographic tools - all accessible from a single terminal.

**2. Is zkTerm free to use?**

Yes, zkTerm is free to use. You only pay blockchain gas fees for on-chain operations (Solana/Starknet transactions). Premium features like large file storage (zkStorage) and AI assistant (zkAI) will require credits via x402 payment system (in development).

**3. Which blockchains does zkTerm support?**

- Solana Mainnet - Live
- Starknet Mainnet & Sepolia - Live
- Zcash - On the roadmap

**4. Do I need to install anything?**

No installation required. Access the terminal directly at [zkterm.io/terminal](https://zkterm.io/terminal). For developers, npm packages are available for API integration.

**5. How do I get started?**

1. Visit [zkterm.io/terminal](https://zkterm.io/terminal)
2. Type `zk help` to see available commands
3. Create a zkID with `zk id register`
4. Start exploring features

## Features

**6. What features are available?**

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| zkID | Universal privacy-preserving identity (`did:zk` format) | Live |
| zkCompression | Light Protocol for Solana token compression | Live |
| zkToolkit | 10-module cryptographic primitives library | Live |
| zkStorage | Encrypted IPFS storage with zkSNARK proofs | Live |
| zkAuth | Passwordless social login with STARK proofs | In Development |

**7. What can I do with zkTerm?**

- Create and manage privacy-preserving identity (zkID)
- Compress tokens to save 5000x on storage costs
- Upload encrypted files to IPFS
- Generate ZK proofs and cryptographic operations
- Manage Solana and Starknet wallets
- Bridge tokens between chains via StarkGate

**8. Which terminal commands are available?**

Type `zk help` in the terminal for the full command list. Main categories:

- `zk id` - Identity operations
- `zk light` - Token compression
- `zk storage` - Encrypted file storage
- `zk toolkit` - Cryptographic primitives
- `zk wallet` - Wallet management
- `zk starknet` - Starknet operations

## Security

**9. Are my private keys safe?**

Yes. All private keys are generated and stored client-side. They never leave your device. Keys are encrypted with your password before storage.

**10. What encryption does zkTerm use?**

- File encryption: AES-256-GCM (client-side)
- Signatures: Ed25519
- Password verification: Groth16 zkSNARKs
- On-chain proofs: STARK (Starknet)

**11. Can I recover my account if I forget my password?**

No. zkTerm uses client-side encryption with no password recovery mechanism. Keep your password and seed phrases safe.

## Payments

**12. What is x402?**

x402 is zkTerm's internal payment system (in development) for resource-consuming features:

- zkStorage - Pay for IPFS storage costs
- zkAI - Pay for AI assistant token usage

Payments accepted in ZKTR, SOL, and USDC.

**13. Is there a free tier?**

Yes. New users get free allowances:

- zkStorage: 10 MB total
- zkAI: 100 queries

## Support

**14. Where can I get help?**

- Twitter/X: [@zkterm](https://x.com/zkterm)
- GitHub: [github.com/zkterm](https://github.com/zkterm)
- Bug reports: Use `zk bug report` in the terminal

**15. Where can I report bugs?**

Use the bug report feature in the terminal or open an issue on GitHub.
