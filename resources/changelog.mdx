## Migration Guide

**v1.x to v2.0**

No breaking changes. v2.0 is fully backward compatible.

New features to try:
```bash
# Compress tokens (Light Protocol)
compress <mint> <amount>

# Private swap (HoudiniSwap)
zk swap --houdini quote USDC SOL 100

# Check rewards
zk rewards status

# View all tokens (regular + compressed)
zk tokens
```

## Deprecations

**Deprecated in v2.0**
- Old zkStorage API endpoints (use `/api/storage/*`)
- Legacy proof format (migrated automatically)

**Removed in v2.0**
- None
