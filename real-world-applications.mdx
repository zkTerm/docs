In this section, we provide an overview of **real-world applications.** Zero-knowledge proofs can be applied to nearly any scenario requiring privacy or verification without disclosure.

### Real-World Applications

1. **Private Token Transfers:** Using zkCompression, you can transfer tokens without revealing exact amounts to observers. Compress your tokens first, then transfer compressed amounts. Recipients can decompress to regular tokens whenever needed. This is ideal for salary payments, large transfers, or any situation where you don't want transaction amounts publicly visible.

2. **Anonymous DAO Voting:** Participate in governance using your zkID without revealing your wallet address or token holdings. Prove you're eligible to vote (e.g., you hold the required tokens) without disclosing how many you hold. This prevents vote buying, coercion, and ensures genuine anonymous participation in decentralized governance.

3. **Confidential Document Storage:** Store sensitive documents - contracts, medical records, financial statements - with client-side encryption and zkSNARK-verified access. Share access selectively by providing decryption keys only to intended recipients. The files remain on IPFS indefinitely, accessible only to those with the correct credentials.

4. **KYC Without Data Exposure:** Prove you've passed identity verification without sharing personal details. Your zkID can attest to verification status while keeping your actual documents private. This enables compliance with regulations while respecting user privacy - perfect for DeFi protocols that need to meet regulatory requirements.

5. **Private DeFi Operations:** Trade, provide liquidity, and earn yield without exposing your wallet balances or transaction history. Compressed tokens hide amounts while maintaining full DeFi functionality. Combined with zkID, you can interact with protocols that require identity verification without compromising privacy.

6. **Cross-Chain Identity Verification:** Use a single zkID across Solana, Starknet, and Zcash. Prove your identity on one chain and have it recognized on others without creating separate accounts or going through multiple verification processes. This simplifies multi-chain operations while maintaining privacy across all networks.

7. **Secure Team Collaboration:** Multiple team members can access shared encrypted files without any single person having full access to decryption keys. Using Shamir secret sharing from zkToolkit, distribute key fragments among team members so that a threshold (e.g., 3 of 5) must cooperate to decrypt sensitive data.

8. **Privacy-Preserving Attestations:** Prove statements about your data without revealing the underlying information. Using zkAttest (zkTLS protocol), you can prove things like "I have more than 1000 Twitter followers" or "my bank balance exceeds $10,000" without exposing actual numbers. This enables trust-minimized verification for lending, reputation systems, and access control.

9. **Developer Integration:** Build privacy features into your own applications using zkTerm's APIs and SDK. The TypeScript-native zkToolkit provides all cryptographic primitives needed to implement custom ZK circuits, proofs, and verification systems. Full documentation and examples available for integration.

10. **Censorship-Resistant Access:** With the decentralized IPFS mirror in development, access zkTerm even if the main website is unavailable. Your data, identity, and tools remain accessible regardless of centralized infrastructure status - true digital sovereignty.
