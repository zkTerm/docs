## What is zkTerm?

zkTerm unifies the fragmented zero-knowledge ecosystem into a single terminal. Instead of juggling multiple tools, SDKs, and chains - access everything from one place.

ZK technology is powerful but scattered across different chains, tools, and standards. zkTerm bridges them all - Solana today, with Starknet and Zcash on the roadmap.

### What You Can Do

- **Own Your Identity** - Create a privacy-preserving ID that works everywhere
- **Store Files Securely** - Encrypt and save files that only you can access
- **Manage Tokens** - View, send, and compress your crypto assets
- **Prove Without Revealing** - Verify things about yourself without sharing personal data

### Built for Freedom

- **Your Keys, Your Control** - Private keys never leave your device
- **No Sign-ups Required** - Just connect and start using
- **Works Everywhere** - Access from any browser, any device
- **Decentralized Access** - Unstoppable mirror via IPFS *(In Development)*
